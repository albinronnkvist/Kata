# Introduction

Coding katas are programming exercises designed to help developers improve their skills through practice and repetition. The concept is inspired by the martial arts practice of kata, where practitioners perform a sequence of moves repeatedly to perfect their technique. In coding, a kata is a small, self-contained programming problem that developers solve to hone their skills.
